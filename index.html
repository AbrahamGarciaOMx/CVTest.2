          In coordination with PM, I provided support to Direct Aid Program assessing expressions
          of interest vs DAP´s strategic priorities, I helped to design a final report of projects,
          using Smartygrants platform, complying with gender perspective reporting, and the final financial
          reporting allowing more transparency and traceability of the funds. In a second stage, I helped to
          thoroughly investigate bid proposals applying 'due diligence' principles validating information
          provided by bidders helping to mitigate risks of fraud in the use of international funds. I also
          collaborated to gather supporting documentation regarding full adherence to DFAT's Child Protection
          Policy. I recorded and organized, in EDRMS (data storage system) contracts, agreements, quotations,
          commercial information, contract variations, creating new files and a directory of all Aid-related
          information. In a third stage, I visited implementers to oversee the execution of the project,
          interview communities and individuals to ensure good use of tax-payers money. When things were not
          aligned according to the plan, I raised my concerns to the organizations and requested action plan
          to correct the deviation.

      <h3>My love for bikes</h3>
      <p>It started with a real disconfort. My commute to work was a nightmare. I sold my car because it
        took me ages to get to work (only 10 kms away), public transport was utterly unconfortable, I was
        mad, sad and tired. I started with an e-bike, becasue, silly me, I thought 10kms was a lot to pedal,
        It's actually achivable. Then the hygene issue, I'm lucky for working for the Australian Embassy, they
        have showers! so problem solved. Then the climate, the worst for a ciclyst is rain, but as they say,
        there is no bad weather, just bad clothing choices, so I cycle even with pouring rain! What about repairs?
        Lots of them, flat tires are the most common, but no matter what repair is needed they are way to much
        cheaper than the cheapest repair of a car. What were the benefits? the almost immediate one is time: 30 minutes
        for daily commute one way, that makes one hour cycling, in gym terms I know (you know) its good. Weight loss? 10 kilos
        in 6 months and then fit the rest of the year. Special diet? not at all, I enjoy more than ever the
        food I like. Blood test results? neat, all the indicators within normal ranges. What about savings?
        The e-bike investment paid back long time ago, I manage to buy other two bikes, one for fun, and other
        for commuting but this time mechanic. I have a little extra income that I use to pay my credit card,
        and I'm almost debt free. Cheap, healthy, good for my pocket, the environment, good for city mobility
        the bike is the old disruptive force that will be here for a while. Many opinionated people? Yes, Lots
        of them that see me filtering lanes to reach my destination before them. At least they are confortable.
        Come and join me! 🚴‍♂️
